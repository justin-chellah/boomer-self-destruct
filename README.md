# [L4D/2] Boomer Self-Destruct
This is a SourceMod Plugin that allows boomers to explode and splatter survivors with vomit by pressing the RELOAD (`[R]` by default) button. This plugin is a good combination for when you're using the [Ghost Fly](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=900622) plugin as players tend to fly toward the survivors before blowing up.

- `boomer_self_destruct_damage_interval` (set to `1.0` by default)
	- How many seconds must elapse before Boomer can blow themself up

# Requirements
- [SourceMod 1.11+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable)

# Supported Games
- Left 4 Dead 2
- Left 4 Dead
